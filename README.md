#  ðŸŽ¨ A Small but Significant Project

This project was developed for a family friend pursuing their Masterâ€™s in Fine Arts at the University of the Free State. The goal was to create a digital component for their exhibition, enhancing the way visitors interacted with the artwork. This digital component would make use of the user's camera on their smartphone and the website to invert the camera colours and give a different perspective of the artwork.

Being part of this exhibition was a proud moment for me, as it was the first time I saw something I had written being used in the real world. It served as a meaningful reminder of why I love technology and writing code â€” demonstrating how I can bridge creativity and functionality to bring ideas to life.

Another memorable part of the process was learning how to host a webpage and treating my family friend as a client. This experience helped me apply everything I had learned during my studies, from gathering requirements to delivering a final product that met their needs. It also gave me insight into the challenges of working on a real-world project, including troubleshooting issues, optimising performance, optimising code, and ensuring accessibility for a diverse audience with different devices.

This project reinforced my passion for developing practical, user-centred solutions and gave me a newfound appreciation for the intersection of technology and the arts.
