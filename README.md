#  üé® A Small but Significant Project

This project was developed for a family friend pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Fine Arts at the University of the Free State. The goal was to create an interactive digital component for their exhibition, enhancing the way visitors engage with the artwork.

##  ‚ú® How It Works
-  The digital experience utilises a user's smartphone camera and a web-based interface.

-  The system inverts the camera colours, offering viewers a unique and altered perspective of the artwork.

-  This interactive element encourages deeper engagement, allowing visitors to see the art in a new and unexpected way.

##  üí° What This Project Meant to Me
Being part of this exhibition was a proud and defining moment, as it was the first time I saw something I had built being used in a real-world setting. It was a powerful reminder of why I love technology and coding‚Äîshowcasing how I can bridge creativity with functionality to create meaningful experiences.

One of the most valuable aspects of this project was learning how to host a webpage and treating my family friend as a client. This experience allowed me to apply everything I had learned during my studies‚Äîfrom gathering requirements to deploying a final product tailored to their needs. 

### ‚öîÔ∏è Challenges
Along the way, I gained insight into real-world challenges such as:

-  Troubleshooting and debugging unexpected issues.

-  Optimising code for performance and cross-device compatibility.

-  Ensuring accessibility for a diverse audience.

This project reinforced my passion for building user-centred solutions and deepened my appreciation for the intersection of technology and the arts. It was a rewarding journey that blended creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills in an exciting and meaningful way.
